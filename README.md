# CV for Lingyu (Jack) Fuca
##### Welcome to my GitHub page! 
At this repository, you may read my CV that is specially designed for my **academic profile (professional profile)**. 

I am currently a PhD student at political science department at Penn State. My research agenda is on **political risk prediction and analysis**, which requires me to keep studying in comparative politics, international politics, and political economy. 

For example, knowing how the domestic political game is played is a significant part of predicting what kinds of political risks would take place at what time in a country or region. Knowing how to correctly interpret signals between two major powers is also significant for predicting regional chaos and conflicts. Political economy, in my research agenda, plays a "glue" like role in connecting CP and IR knowledge together via social networks, spillover effects, and so on.

I also study and apply multiple methods, and my major "toolbox" is from data science---machine learning and developing algorithm. While the major "bridge" that connects my toolbox with my research questions is closer to the mindset of political economy and game theory---how human beings behave under complex circumstances. 

I really appreciate if you find my research ideas and mindsets interesting. And I welcome all kinds of constructive discussions on acadmeic research, because I believe learning is a life-time thing to do. Cheers.
